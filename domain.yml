  utter_issue:
  - text: "Well. I've been pastoring the church for the last 25 years and 
            I have built up a nice congregation. My wife's at home with Alzheimer's. 
            I feel very guilty these days because I've been drinking pretty heavily "

  utter_wife_issue:
  - text: "It's not an easy situation. My wife has good days and bad days. And on the bad days, I get affected the most. You know my son helps a lot around the house but he is working on his PhD.
             and he doesn’t have time to help me out that much. "

  utter_tried_to_cut_back_what_worked:
  - text: "When I focus on trying to exercise more, when I meet with friends 
          but I don't have a lot of time to do that with my current situation. 
          That’s why I could never get any consistent with any of that. "
  - text: "Back in the day I used to swim every day. That was very relaxing. But I can't take exercise often much anymore
          You know with my current situation if I could just find some way to do it regularly, I think it will help."

  utter_suggestion:
  - text: "Yeah, that`s a pretty good idea. I will make sure to do that!"

  utter_confidence:
  - text: "Oh on a scale of 1 to 10, at least an eight."
  - text: "On a scale of 1 to 10, probably about six or seven. It’s because I haven’t been successful in maintaining it in the past. "
