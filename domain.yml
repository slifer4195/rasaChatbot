  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hi"

  utter_introduce:
  - text: "Well. I've been pastoring the church for the last 25 years and 
            I have built up a nice congregation. My wife's at home with Alzheimer's. 
            I feel very guilty these days because I've been drinking pretty heavily and I don't want 
            to disappoint people. But it’s the only way I’ve been able to cope lately."

  utter_issue:
  - text: "It's not an easy situation. My wife has good days and bad days. And on the bad days, I get affected the most. You know my son helps a lot around the house but he is working on his PhD.
             and he doesn’t have time to help me out that much. It's just very painful to watch it deteriorate and the drinking helps me cope."

  utter_respond:
  - text: "Yes, it has been pretty hard for me."

  utter_benefit:
  - text: "It calms me down, helps me sleep, and makes it easier for me to communicate with people."
  - text: "I know it's not healthy for me but it's the most cost-efficient way for me to calm down these days."

  utter_attempt:
  - text: "You know I've been successful sometimes."
  - text: "I can cut back to two or three beers a day but then something will always come up to trigger it again."
  - text: "You know something will happen at church, I have a problem with trying to communicate with my wife, or something in the family."

  utter_solution:
  - text: "When I focus on trying to exercise more, when I meet with friends 
          but I don't have a lot of time to do that with my current situation. 
          That’s why I could never get any consistent with any of that. "
  - text: "Back in the day I used to swim every day. That was very relaxing. But I can't take exercise often much anymore
          You know with my current situation if I could just find some way to do it regularly, I think it will help."

  utter_suggestion:
  - text: "Yeah, that`s a pretty good idea. I will make sure to do that!"

  utter_confidence:
  - text: "Oh on a scale of 1 to 10, at least an eight."
  - text: "On a scale of 1 to 10, probably about six or seven. It’s because I haven’t been successful in maintaining it in the past. "
  - text: "I don`t think I can do it"

  utter_question:
  - text: "I have been drinking a lot. About 2 wo or three beers a night with a couple of shots."
  - text: "My drinking habit`s been pretty bad. I would say 2 to 3 beers a night"

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Bye"
